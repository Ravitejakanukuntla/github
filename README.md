# Placement Prediction using Python and Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a student getting placed in a job based on various factors using machine learning techniques. It provides a web interface powered by Streamlit to easily interact with the prediction model.

## Features
Training and testing machine learning models: The project allows you to train and evaluate different machine learning models on a provided dataset. You can experiment with various algorithms and techniques to find the best model for placement prediction.

Prediction: Once the model is trained, you can input the relevant features of a student, such as their academic performance, skills, and experience, and the system will predict the probability of the student getting placed.

Web interface powered by Streamlit: The project provides a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit. It allows you to easily input the required data and obtain predictions in real-time, without requiring any programming knowledge.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.6+
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
You can install the dependencies using pip:

### pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit

# Clone the repository:

### git clone https://github.com/Rupak09/Placement-Prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

### cd placement-prediction
Prepare the dataset:

Place your dataset file in the project directory.
Update the file path in the code to match your dataset file.
## Train the model:

Run the training script:

#### python train_model.py
The script will preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, train the machine learning model, and save it to a file.
Launch the web interface:

## Run the following command:

### streamlit run model5.py
The Streamlit application will start, and you can access it in your browser by visiting the provided URL.
Interact with the web interface:

Input the required details, such as academic performance, skills, and experience.
Click the "Predict" button.
The application will display the probability of placement based on the provided information.
Customization
You can customize the project according to your needs:

Update the dataset: Replace the existing dataset file with your own dataset. Make sure to adjust the data preprocessing and feature engineering steps accordingly.

Modify the machine learning models: Experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature selection techniques to improve the prediction accuracy.

Enhance the web interface: Customize the design, add additional input fields, or provide more detailed insights about the prediction results.
